## The Code Book
This code book indicates all the variables and summaries calculated in this data set, along with units, and any other relevant information.

## Data Sets

After running the script you will find a .text file in the directory. It will be named: `final_data.txt`

### final_data

Set of all data collected in the Human Activity Recognition using Smart Phone Data Set, aggregated into averages by activity type and participant. Accordingly the data set is arranged along the following variables:

 [1] "participant" - factor variable indicating the participant               [2] "activitylabel" - factor variable indicating the type of activity          [3] "set" - factor variable indicating whether the reading is part of the training or test set

The following are gyroscopic readings from the smart-phone or calculated based on these readings. The readings are averaged from all readings taken for each activity and contestant and do not represent raw data.
